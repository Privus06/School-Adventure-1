    pseudocode for chapter 3 homework assignment

    create an array of strings with a size of 10.
    explain the story to the player, whatever story you wish to tell.
        the player starts with 3 items.
        over the course of several adventures, 
        1.  the player gains 3 items and has to name each of them.
            for example: BunnySword or FlameGuitar
             - because of cin limitations, the name can only be one word.
        2.  the player uses 1 item, making it go away.
        3. at each change in inventory - show the changes with a for loop that ignores strings that have "" no characters.
        
        For the final challenge, the player must give up their most treasured item to the bridge troll (or similar) to get past the bridge.
            The player will have to search for that item inside of a for loop.
