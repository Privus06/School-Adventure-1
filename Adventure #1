/*welcome the player
set up the game
    int health = 10, attack, block, turns = 0
    seed the random number generator
start the loop
    add 1 to turns
    start the encounter
        randomly generate numbers for attack (range = 0-4) and block (range = 0-4)
        if block is greater or equal to attack, successful block
        otherwise, subtract attack value from health.
keep looping while health is greater than zero and fewer than 4 turns have happened

if health is greater than 0, congratulate player
otherwise, tell the player they're dead.

Beyond effort and polish (some of which is described below), here are some other things you can do to improve your grade:
Make the number of turns before the adventure is over random.
If the player's health is below a certain number, tell them to go see the doctor.
Incorporate sleep() to change the pacing of the game and not have it all come out at once.
Send me a link in the comments to your assignment hosted publicly, like on github.com (good for showing off what you know to future employers)
Ask the player if they'd like to see all of the numbers used in the game (a debug mode) and if they do, post them at every point they're used. */
